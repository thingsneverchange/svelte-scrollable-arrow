## 1.1.0

1. ID was visible even when there's no value set up.
2. Added a new `drag event` for the desktop.
3. Added props for `___scrollTo` `(value: number, props?: { behavior: 'auto' | 'smooth'  }) => void`
4. Changed arrow positions from `20px` to `15px` for each.
5. Fixed the not touchable issue when the shadow is disabled as it used to change the background only.
6. Added `.scroll_view_shadow` to the container when `arrowShadow` is enabled.
